# Testing Rules

## 1. Mandatory Tests

- Every new feature must have at least one automated test.
- Every bug fix must include a regression test.

## 2. Test Quality

- Tests must be independent and repeatable.
- Use mocks for external APIs to ensure consistent results.

## 3. Coverage

- Aim for 80% line coverage. Critical paths (Auth, Payments) require 100%.
