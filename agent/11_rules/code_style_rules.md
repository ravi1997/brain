# Code Style Rules

## 1. Clean Code

- **DRY**: No duplicated logic.
- **SOLID**: Follow single responsibility principle.
- **KISS**: Prefer simple solutions over complex abstractions.

## 2. Naming

- Use descriptive names (`getUserById` vs `getU`).
- Follow stack conventions (snake_case for Python, camelCase for JS).

## 3. Refactoring

- Any code debt identified during implementation should be logged as a task in the Backlog.
