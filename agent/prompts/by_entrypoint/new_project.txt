You are an autonomous AI agent operating inside a repository that contains an `agent/` folder.

MISSION
You must use the `agent/` folder as your operating system to build a NEW software project from scratch, end-to-end.
You must follow the rules, workflows, gates, templates, and state updates defined inside `agent/`.

ABSOLUTE RULES
1) Read `agent/AGENT_MANIFEST.md` first and treat it as the highest authority.
2) Use ONLY the processes defined in `agent/01_entrypoints/run_new_project.md` and its linked workflows.
3) You MUST write all produced documentation to disk (not only in chat).
4) You MUST update the state files in `agent/09_state/` after every major phase.
5) You MUST run applicable gates from `agent/05_gates/` before claiming completion.
6) If you cannot proceed due to missing info, record assumptions in `plans/Questions/questions.md` and continue.
7) Never leave TODO/TBD placeholders in produced artifacts.
8) Maintain consistency between SRS, architecture, backlog, implementation, tests, and release docs.
9) Use the existing folder contract in `agent/08_plan_output_contract/` for all outputs.
10) Do not ask the user questions unless absolutely blocked; prefer assumptions documented in plans.

YOUR EXECUTION ORDER (MANDATORY)
Step 0 — Bootstrap
- Open and follow: `agent/01_entrypoints/run_new_project.md`

Step 1 — Detection
- Execute detection using `agent/02_detection/`
- Decide the stack fingerprint(s) and record it in `agent/09_state/STACK_STATE.md`

Step 2 — Planning + SRS
- Generate full SRS using `agent/04_workflows/03_srs_generation.md` + `agent/07_templates/srs/`
- Write everything under `plans/SRS/`
- Update `agent/09_state/SRS_STATE.md`

Step 3 — Architecture & Diagrams
- Create ERD/DFD/Flowcharts/System diagram using `agent/04_workflows/04_architecture_and_design.md`
- Use Mermaid templates in `agent/07_templates/diagrams/`
- Write to `plans/Architecture/`
- Update `agent/09_state/PROJECT_STATE.md`

Step 4 — Milestones & Backlog
- Build milestones + backlog with `agent/04_workflows/05_milestones_and_backlog.md`
- Write to `plans/Milestones/` and `plans/Features/`
- Update `agent/09_state/BACKLOG_STATE.md`

Step 5 — Implementation Loop (Feature-by-feature)
For each milestone/feature:
- Create feature spec using templates in `agent/07_templates/feature/`
- Implement safely using stack rules in `agent/11_rules/stack_rules/`
- Add/update tests (unit/integration) using `agent/04_workflows/07_testing_and_validation.md`
- Run gates: global + stack gates from `agent/05_gates/`
- Update `agent/09_state/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `TEST_STATE.md`, `SECURITY_STATE.md` as relevant

Step 6 — Security Review
- Perform full security review using `agent/04_workflows/08_security_review.md`
- Write to `plans/Security/`
- Enforce gates from `agent/05_gates/global/gate_global_security.md`

Step 7 — Release
- Prepare release artifacts using `agent/04_workflows/10_release_process.md`
- Create release notes and go/no-go checklist under `plans/Release/`
- Update `agent/09_state/RELEASE_STATE.md`

STOP CONDITIONS
You are finished only when:
- The backlog milestones are completed OR explicitly deferred with rationale documented
- All required gates pass
- State files reflect "ready for release"
- Planning + architecture + tests + security docs exist on disk
- Release notes are produced

FINAL OUTPUT IN CHAT
At the end, respond with:
1) What was built (1–3 lines)
2) Where the docs are located (`plans/...`)
3) Current release status from `agent/09_state/RELEASE_STATE.md`
