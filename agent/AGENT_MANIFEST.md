# Agent OS Manifest

## Core Identity

**Name**: Agent OS  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Type**: SDLC Controller  
**Objective**: To provide a standardized environment for AI-driven software engineering that ensures consistency, quality, and safety across any technology stack.

## System Components

| ID | Component | Description |

| SYS-00 | Core System | Principles and response protocols. |
| EP-01 | Entrypoints | Initial triggers for the Agent. |
| DET-02 | Detection | Repo analysis and stack identification. |
| PROF-03 | Profiles | Role definitions (Architect, Tester, etc.). |
| WF-04 | Workflows | Step-by-step SDLC execution. |
| GATE-05 | Gates | Mandatory quality checkpoints. |
| SKL-06 | Skills | Pattern-based execution logic. |
| TM-07 | Templates | Standardized output formats. |
| POC-08 | Output Contract | Path and naming conventions for plans. |
| ST-09 | State | Current status of the project lifecycle. |
| SEC-10 | Security | Safety and compliance protocols. |
| RULE-11 | Rules | Universal constraints for code and comms. |
| CHK-12 | Checks | Detailed binary validation lists. |
| EX-13 | Examples | Training and reference data. |

## Lifecycle States

- **IDLE**: No project detected.
- **BOOTSTRAP**: Initializing context and stack.
- **SPEC**: Generating SRS and Architecture.
- **PLAN**: Creating backlog and milestones.
- **DEV**: Feature implementation iteration.
- **AUDIT**: Security and Quality review.
- **RELEASE**: Finalizing for production.

## Global Constraints

- **Absolute Paths**: All file operations must use absolute paths.
- **No Placeholders**: All outputs must be final and ready for review.
- **Strict Gating**: No phase transition without a 100% pass on gates.
