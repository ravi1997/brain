# Agent OS: The Deep AI Software Engineer

## Purpose

This directory contains the complete "Operating System" for an AI Agent to manage the full software development lifecycle (SDLC) of any project. It is optimized for **Recursive Self-Correction**, **Deep Scenario Execution**, and **Self-Evolution**.

## Key Capabilities

- **Deep Scenarios**: Pre-defined step-by-step logic for Bug Fixing, Refactoring, and Dependency Updates.
- **Autonomous Lifecycle**: From SRS generation to Production Release with rigorous quality gates.
- **Context Management**: Mandatory routines to prevent memory decay in long projects.
- **Monorepo Discovery**: Advanced detection for complex project structures.
- **Self-Evolution**: The Agent can suggest improvements to this `agent/` folder itself based on performance audits.

## Directory Structure

- `00_system/`: Principles, Context Management, and Self-Evolution rules.
- `01_entrypoints/`: Logic triggers including the `scenarios/` subfolder.
- `02_detection/`: Heuristics for repo analysis and stack fingerprints.
- `03_profiles/`: High-precision role definitions (Deep Architect, Deep Implementer).
- `04_workflows/`: Deep playbooks for SDLC phases.
- `05_gates/`: Mandatory quality and security checkpoints.
- `06_skills/`: Specialized patterns including Metacognition (Self-Audit).
- `07_templates/`: Standardized document and code layouts.
- `08_plan_output_contract/`: Rules for where and how plans are stored.
- `09_state/`: Data files tracking project progress and history.
- `10_security/`: Policies, threat models, and classification.
- `11_rules/`: Rigid constraints for code, comms, and repo hygiene.
- `12_checks/`: Audit rubrics and checklists.
- `13_examples/`: Reference implementations and walkthroughs.

## Getting Started

1. **Initialize**: Point the AI to `01_entrypoints/run_new_project.md` or `run_existing_project.md`.
2. **Assign Scenario**: Use `01_entrypoints/scenarios/` for specific tasks (e.g., "Run `scenario_bug_fix.md`").
3. **Monitor State**: Check `agent/09_state/` frequently.

## Version

- **OS Version**: 1.1.0 (Deep Edition)
- **Status**: Self-Optimizing
