## 🔄 Medium Priority


## 🧊 Low Priority / Future Ideas
- [ ] migration to a graph database for knowledge storage?
- [ ] Multi-user support

## ✅ Completed
- [x] **Manual System Verification (Build & Test Pass)**
- [x] Dashboard refactor to React components (O(1) Memory, Mega-Batch NLU)

## 🔮 Future Roadmap (Realistic Generated)

## 🎨 UI / UX Enhancements
- [x] Add dark mode toggle to the dashboard header
- [x] Refactor "Cognition" view to use specific color codes for emotions
- [x] precise alignment of the navigation bar
- [ ] Add a "Clear Console" button to the debug logs
- [ ] Create a responsive layout for mobile devices
