# Milestone Plan - Brain Replica

## M1: Stabilization & Foundation
**Goal**: Ensure the system is secure, buildable, and provides a stable base for development.
- **M1.1**: Rootless Docker Implementation (DONE)
- **M1.2**: Project Configuration via Environment Variables
- **M1.3**: Robust Build System Logic (libpq detection)
- **M1.4**: Local Dependency Management Script

## M2: Access Control & Security
**Goal**: Protect the brain's internal state and interaction ports from unauthorized access.
- **M2.1**: Token-based Security for Admin Port
- **M2.2**: UI Authentication for Dashboard
- **M2.3**: Encrypted Synaptic Weight Persistence
- **M2.4**: TLS/SSL Support for WebSocket Proxy

## M3: Cognitive depth & Biological Dynamics
**Goal**: Advance the AI's "biological" simulation and cognitive capabilities.
- **M3.1**: Sleep-Cycle & Memory Consolidation (Consolidating STM to LTM)
- **M3.2**: Natural Memory Decay (TTL-based forgetting in Postgres)
- **M3.3**: Advanced Sentiment & Emotion Mapping
- **M3.4**: Multi-lingual Stop Word Integration

## M4: Performance & Scaling
**Goal**: Optimize neural processing for real-time hardware scenarios and large memory bases.
- **M4.1**: Parallel Neural Region Processing (TBB Integration)
- **M4.2**: Semantic Cache Layer (Redis optimization)
- **M4.3**: HNSW Index Parameter Tuning for Scale

## Timeline Strategy
1. **Immediate**: Complete M1 to unblock external contributors.
2. **Short-term**: Deploy M2 to secure existing deployments.
3. **Mid-term**: Iterate on M3 to fulfill the core cognitive mission.
