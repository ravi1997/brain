# SRS: Context - Brain Replica

## Purpose
The Brain Replica is a digital simulation of a cognitive architecture. It aims to provide a modular, extensible, and biologically-inspired AI agent that can interact with users, maintain long-term memory, emotional states, and execute tasks autonomously.

## Target Audience
- **Developers**: Extending the neural architecture or integrating with external hardware (ROS 2).
- **Researchers**: Studying cognitive dynamics, memory consolidation, and neural learning patterns.
- **Power Users**: Interacting with the brain for specialized task offloading.

## Business Goals
- Create a low-latency, "always-on" cognitive companion.
- Implement a robust RAG-lite memory system for long-term consistency.
- Standardize the communication between neural processing and UI/Hardware.
