# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a comprehensive documentation file (QWEN.md) for a sophisticated C++ brain simulation system that implements cognitive architecture with neural networks, learning phases, and knowledge management.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: C++20, CMake 3.20+, with neural networks implementing synaptic plasticity
- **Project Structure**: 
  - `brain.hpp`: Core brain simulation with cognitive modules (Vision, Memory, Attention, World Model, etc.)
  - `dnn.hpp`: Deep neural network implementation with plasticity mechanisms
  - `main.cpp`: Interactive brain simulation interface
  - `test_brain_simulation.cpp`: Comprehensive test suite
- **Build Commands**: `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j$(nproc)`
- **Architecture**: Multi-module cognitive system with dynamic learning phases (Acquisition, Consolidation, Retrieval, Testing)
- **Core Features**: Knowledge hierarchy management, conflict resolution, adaptive learning, memory consolidation, synaptic pruning

## Recent Actions
- **Analysis Completed**: Thoroughly examined all project files including header files, main implementation, and test files
- **QWEN.md Created**: Generated comprehensive documentation covering project overview, architecture, building/running instructions, and advanced features
- **System Understanding**: Identified sophisticated features like neural plasticity, Hebbian learning, homeostatic regulation, and eligibility traces

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Analyze project files to understand the brain simulation architecture
2. [DONE] Document key components including neural networks, cognitive modules, and learning systems
3. [DONE] Create comprehensive QWEN.md with build/run instructions and usage examples
4. [DONE] Include advanced features like synaptic plasticity, memory management, and conflict resolution in documentation
